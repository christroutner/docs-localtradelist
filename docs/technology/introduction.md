# Introduction

Local Trade List leverages open protocols and open source software to create a simple, robust platform to help neighbors trade with neighbors. It is intended to be a *global*, *decentralized* alternative to *regional*, *centralized* online marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.

Craigslist for example is only available in the USA and Canada. It has become increasingly restrictive over the years. For example, they have removed their personal ads and restrict the selling of goods such as unpasteurized milk, all due to potential legal liability. Facebook has become an infamous posterchild for censorship of 'wrong think'.

Local communities require solutions to their local needs, free from the coercive forces of the State and Big Tech. Cryptographic technologies like blockchain, encryption, and the interplanetary file system ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io)) make that possible. Local Trade List is designed to meet those needs.

A 'store' on the Local Trade List app is represented on the blockchain as a cryptographic token. The store is anchored in the blockchain, but the bulk of the data, like images and products, are stored on the IPFS network. The app itself and all infrastructure required to operate it is free and open source, meaning that anyone can run their own copy of [LocalTradeList.com](https://localtradelist.com).

If Local Trade List is valuable and convenient to local communities, and if many copies are operated around the world, then no central government can stop individuals from trading with one another.
